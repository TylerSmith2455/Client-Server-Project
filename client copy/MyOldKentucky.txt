Oh, the sun shines bright
On my old Kentucky home
'Tis summer,
The old folks are gay
Well, the corn top's ripe
And the meadow's in the bloom
While the birds make music
All the day
Weep no more, my lady
Oh, weep no more, today
We sing one song
For my old Kentucky home
For my old Kentucky home
Far away.
Well, the young folks roll
All around the cabin floor
They're merry, all
Happy and bright
By 'n by hard times will
A-come a-knockin' at my door
Then my old Kentucky home
Good night
Weep no more, my lady
No, weep no more, today
We sing one song
For my old Kentucky home
For my old Kentucky home
Far away.
Weep no more, my lady
Oh, weep no more, today
We sing one song
For my old Kentucky home
For my old Kentucky home
Far away.
For my old Kentucky home
Far away
